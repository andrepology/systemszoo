## Outline 2
+ Bifurcated history: West and East. Start shops we see today. 
	+ But! Can we essentialise the history of a diaspora? 
		+ Consider: trade and sociality, and the concept of socialist mobilities to enrich the discussion about Vietnamese diaspora in Germany. 
		+ How do transnational migration flows mediate the transition from central economy to market based economy. 
		+ The East/West narrative is more complicated than "workers come, they get disenfranchised, they start small businesses". It is perhaps a story of changing historical conditions from socialist nation building to emerging global markets, around a move from collectivism to individualism that motivates immigration. 
			+ Not just: contract workers were disenfranchised, remained illegally, started businesses. 
				+ Along with contract workers, there were also knowledge workers. Engineers, architects, sent to study under solidarity agreements shaped by the socialist creed. 
					+ Scholarships, joint study, stipends
		  + Essay: analyse the history of the humble Spatkauf storefront as a monument to Vietnamese diasporic identities. 
			  + Hope: de-essentialise and de-homogenise this, by moving from a national unit of analysis (the "Vietnamese") to individual levels. 
			  + Transnational migration on an economic level, with a profile of an architect sent to Bauhaus University during the wartime era of Vietnam, and religious, with a profile of a lay Buddhist female shopkeeper. 
			
+ Economic: Goods are sent here, what is sent back? 
	+ Consider one such local case: architecure student. 
		+ Study: earn skills to build a "modern socialist society" in Vietnam. 
			+ Parrallells: a collectivist framework for migration to individual models of choice || socialist migrations -> capitalist migrations
				+ Contrary to the "seeking opportunities" studeied at the family-level. 
		+ Savings enabled him to send 'care pacakges' back home, and offered a new path to upward mobility to his family back home, who experienced harship at the hands of central planning in a fading NVD. 
		+ Went to study under progressive socialist ideas, ended up trading. 
	+ HIgher earinings -> Support family -> Engage with informal trade markets to supplement earnings -> support families more. 
		+ Gained economic mobility. 
		+ In doing so, established a global market economy for goods. 
+  On a general level, these cases of students as conduits for Vietnam transitioning out of a centrally planned economy to a market economy.
