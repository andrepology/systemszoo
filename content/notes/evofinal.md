You will be able to choose any topic from the semester and apply it to any relevant context you would like.

Structure your proposal in three sections (1200-1500 words) with a fourth section for justification (up to 300 words):

1.  Introduction: Provide background that culminates in the hypothesis
2.  Research design: Describe how the hypothesis will be tested
3.  Expected results and interpretations: Explain what results would and would not support the hypothesis, and potential alternative explanations.
4.  Justification (additional 300 words beyond the 1200-1500 words of the previous three sections): Describe how your proposal relates to the funding opportunity.



Prepare a 2-minute presentation outlining your **grant proposal ideas for the final project**. This will be used for an in-class activity where you will be able to get some feedback on your final project.

### LOs

- [#ns112-geneticdrift](https://forum.minerva.edu/app/outcome-index/learning-outcomes/ns112-geneticdrift?course_id=2135): Explain the mechanisms of random allele frequency change in populations, and apply theory to evaluate the probability of fixation for different scenarios.    
- [#ns112-naturalselection](https://forum.minerva.edu/app/outcome-index/learning-outcomes/ns112-naturalselection?course_id=2135): Distinguish modes of selection, calculate the strength of selection, and analyze the impact of selection on genetic variance within and between populations.
- [#ns112-geneticvariationandheritability](https://forum.minerva.edu/app/outcome-index/learning-outcomes/ns112-geneticvariationandheritability?course_id=2135): Distinguish the diverse genetic mechanisms (e.g., random mutation, non-randomness in mutation rates, epistasis, polygenic variation) and epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., methylation) that influence phenotypic traits and their inheritance.
- [#ns112-ecorelationships](https://forum.minerva.edu/app/outcome-index/learning-outcomes/ns112-ecorelationships?course_id=2135): Determine the costs and benefits of interactions among organisms to evaluate hypotheses explaining the nature and consequences of the interaction.
