> Using web3, we want to credibly demonstrate the affective loop, because demonstrating the affective loop demonstrates how a community dashboard can be used to coordinate action at scale. 


> Impetus (Passive) Layer: Present Y
- The impetus provides large-scale context (Health, Economics, Education) for the city 
	- Likely common to either approach, so our dev (API facade) and design (Indicator Carousel + Panel) thus far should be agnostic/support this layer. 
  
> Interact (Active): If X -> Y.1
+ If X -> Y : generate hypotheses, make predictions
+ Provides a way of interacting with the impetus to cultivate greater understanding, inform affective action, drill down into what precisely you can do  
+ Needs to be guided but also explorative  
+ Modeling! Uses models to group correlated data to a larger, composite output, often with distributions over that output  

 > Affect: Do X.1 
+ “Do something to achieve predictions” <- what’s a problem where it makes sense to do the predictions  
	+ #visualisation #todo: What do you do to advance the progress bar? 
+ Register/Provide feedback on contribution of part to whole
