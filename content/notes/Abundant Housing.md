	+ Make the model, replicate it elsewhere
	+ Housing Reform 
		+ Extend supply, not subsidize demand
		+ Stable Rent Rates
		+ Contradiction at the heart of housing
			+ Local restrictions (zoning codes) set at the local level create residential lockdown
				+ Cost of housing increases with market demand (tech workers in SF)
			+ Affordable Housing approach at policy level
				+ No "housing" policy, there is "real estate" policy
				+ Tax code; $250-300B on tax breaks to home ownership
					+ -> Treat homes as an investment vehicle, instead of a place to live
						+ Tax-free cap gains on value of home increasing
						+ Prop tax deductibility
				+ Banks: Feed the Horses to Feed the Sparrows
					+ Support Mortgage banks -> Get funds out to masses to buy homes via loans. 
						+ (a federal guarantee to banks that are too big to fail) 
	+ Cannot have **affordable housing** and **rising home values**
		+ US policy has picked the latter
