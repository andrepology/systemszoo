# Buy Me A Coffee Apps

> Thesis: By using a collection of experiments that explore the intersection of data science and design, I want to synthesise a "systems-based" product management framework.

**Themes**: 
+ Open Source Software, 
+ Online communities supported by open software,
+ Shared conceptual frameworks to realise an abstract ideal (eg "Open Science")

**Projects** 
+ Experiments in Open Science
	+ Skepsi
		+ Annotation API
	+ Abstract Poetry
		+ MVP

**Progress**
What does the framework look like so far?
+ **Units of work**: Design Challenges
	+ Unconventional Points of Entry :: temporarily less user-centric/efficient
		+ Digital Humanities -> Open Science
+ **Abstracting Patterns**
	+ Research -> Design Question or Problem -> Design solution
+ **Documentation as Process**
	+ An **ongoing** research system that feeds into design drafts, and vice versa
	+ An ongoing log of **artefacts of progress (design logs, work logs, drafts)** that are easily traced, commented on

### Proposal
+ [Cover Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tFPnlLuriOXoiMibkZeykXH8x3zcW90326i5n1qixBg/edit)

### Introduction and Background (400-600 words)

+ Predicated on customers making decisions that they will stick to. 
+ product management as as a process of converting business requirements to code. 




### Project Description
Brief **statement** of the specific problem, question, focus, or thesis, with **justification**.

Clear description of the **intended methodology**, with analysis and justification, including **reference to prior work in the field**.

Brief description of the **intended deliverables/outcomes**, with justification. For now, a table of writeups, with feedback.

Second, a writeup (Summer)
+ Critique of PM as it stands today, and scope for improvement. 

Two relational databases: **Experiments** & **Units of Work**. 


### Feasibility Analysis
+ Feasibility Analysis (Length: 150–250 words)
	+ Analysis and justification of the project’s feasibility, both in general and for you in particular. 
	+ This part of the proposal should convey your understanding of and ability to **address likely challenges**. 
	+ Meaningful **preliminary work products** and **your accompanying analysis** are essential for a passing proposal; they may be appropriate to present here and/or in appendices.
	+ If you are proposing a project with **external dependencies**, this section should also succinctly address any associated considerations.
	+ Include a description of **backup plans and stretch goals**.
		+ Commit to one. 
	
	+ "Units of Work" are *design challenges* rather than apps with users/stong testing loops, by default. 

+ Units of Work
	+ **Design** 
		+ **"Ladder of Abstraction"** as the organizing logic of Figma boards 
		+ Design documentation templates + Visibility
			+ Quartz Hosting
	+ **Code**
+ References
+ Appendices
	+ Appendix A. Goals, specific objectives, deliverables, and deadlines. 
		+ Specify at least 5 specific components of your overall project, and the associated milestones, key results, and/or deliverables for each part. 
	+ Appendix B. HCs, LOs, and other metrics or rubrics.
	+ Appendix C. Sources of relevant support, advice, and feedback.
	+ Appendix D. External dependencies.
		+ Team/Collaborations. 



+ Design Documentation
+ Design as a system 
+ Top Level
	+ A strong, motivated user flow that is nonconfrontational
		+ based on learnings from [[Dashboard Typology]], existing dashboards are *crammed full*
