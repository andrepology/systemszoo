## Decomposing the Universe of Indicators
> Approach I: Root Problems Considering the root of social problems, and considering how the dashboard might address these

-   **consumerist news cycles in politics**
    -   we shouldn't care about policies every two years: is the dashboard the right way to address this?

> Approach II: Considering mechanisms of affect

-   `alias: levers / tractable points of control`
    -   ((smart contracts are very good at validating this stuff))
        -   Anchoring behavior in a token
    -   Specific mechanisms
        -   **vote**
        -   **share**
        -   **donate**
        -   **contribute time/expertise/experience**
        -   #presentation
            -   visually communicate momentum

-   How might dashboards be _affective_?
    -   "Decisions should not be difficult" #user Yufei
    -   "How do I feel like I have the abilty to do something small, and that small thing can affect the whole, larger, scary, intimidating thing?" - #user Yufei
        -   This is the key user question to answer (for me, at least)
        -   #visualisation: How do visualizations **persuade or nudge this**, and how can these be exciting or curious enough to monitor, interact with on a frequent basis?
        -   Small enough to do **casually**, but **convincing that its affecting something**
            -   Time sensitivity might be a crucial part. Donating to a climate policy associated with a climate indicator might not be a good choice, as there's significant lag between cause and effect.
            -   "**$400** to buy a **bulletproof vest**, donate."
                -   But how do we indicate **completion**?
                -   Fundraiser language, progress bar
