+ Intro: A community dashboard for SF that helps citizens begin to interact with and **have agency** over their city.
+ Background: Dashboard Typology
+ Problem: The Affective Loop
+ Potential Collaboration
	+ How might a dashboard be used as coordination infrastructure for a community using a community coin?
		+ Address:
			+ How might my part (vote, donation, contribution) relate to the whole?
			+ how might we, as citizens, assert autonomy over our data?


keep going back to the devils advocate: why dont we just use tableau/powerbi/carto/host our own thing with a nice UI wrapper if we haven't found a clear affective loop yet? at what point do we just stop and switch back to the easier approach
