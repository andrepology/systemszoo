### Review of Tweetscape, and how it should inform our stack
-   Neat, appropriate technologies! Love the stress on performance: it’s almost vital to its success as presentation layer over Twitter, and how it was put together with so much clarity.
-   But, word of caution: the concept **addresses a pain point** that users have and seems to resonate widely, but twitter won't change because its optimising for something else and therefore has to leave this out.
    -   This has an **incredibly robust API to store lots of data**
    -   For our project, a lot more conceptual work needs to be done, let alone considering data sources/pipelines, so it’s slightly harder to plan overall, let alone commit to technologies. I think that hesitation comes through after reading these notes!
    -   #devilsadvocate : can this end in two months with a very strong whitepaper or proof of concept?
        -   And a supporting "here's our vision" Figma prototype to display during the conference
