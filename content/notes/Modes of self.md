+ #pulse: Spoke to Ahmed in at Kremanski, and he talked about how there's "versions" of onself
	+ For #example, the mother that is a manger has a "manager" self that she brings home, asks her kids if they did their homework, brushed their teeth etc, and the "mother" self that is nurturing, warm.
	+ The #principle seems to be that we need to recognise these selves, and know how to cultivate or practice them intentionally.
		+ For #example, I need to feel very safe and comfortable with myself and my environment to be in tune with my creative side. On the other hand, I need a kind of ruthless criticism when I'm coding or engaging rationally that is at ends with this other side. 
			+ Breaking down problems, knowing what to attempt first, efficiency speed: rational self
			+ "what about this?", "this isn't there yet" is the creative side
