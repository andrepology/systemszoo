> #idea Real-time dashboard for 

### Purpose
+ Get feet wet with [[D3.js]]
	+ ie start with an interactive line chart with lots of examples, then draw on [[McCandless]] or Alpine Cartographies
+ Extend the idea of [[uncertainty cognition]]
	+ We have diminishing perception of large numbers
	+ So: here is BTC energy consumption in units of:
		+ Rocket Trips to the Moon
		+ Goats
+ Figure out how to collab effectively, which might rely on [[Continuous Integration]]


#plan:
+ render historical price info
	+ in that time, figure out a model 
+ is [[Storybook]] actually fast to develop? 


# #worklog 
+ Made some updates to the sense of Perspective using [[Spline]], which has a nice [[React]] wrapper I should test `react-spline`
+ Still tweaking design, missing a clarity of purpose
	+ One approach should be a crisp, helvetica form that renders a stream of emojis. 
	+ Another approach is more visual, modular to modification.
