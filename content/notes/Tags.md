+ What is the different between a **principle** and a **pattern**?
+ Notes should have **patterns of microevolution**, and the system should support that [[Evolution across multiple scales | evolution]]. 
+ Tags are essentially **HCs/LOs**. Scaffolding you can and should cross apply to glue knowledge together. 
	+ Use HCs and LOs. 
+ Ideally you want to take a large tag #hci, and decompose it into LOs over time

# Extant Tags
+ #todo: a stuff you need to do. Prepend to other tags. 
+ #pattern : a pattern of thought, software or design that you should cross apply. Multiple instances of a pattern should be refactored to a tag.
+ #idea : an idea, small or large. Used to normalise inline, roundabout, random ideas. Ideally refactor to a lowercase page. 
+ #worklog: a header for a stream of timestamped text. 
	+ #todo: do some kind of versioning, so you can make a CHANGELOG
+ #separationofconcerns: a software pattern about making things do one thing at a time. 
+ #meta: a larger point, often helped to frame this note taking system. Distinguished from self-reflective #pulse. 
+ #principle: a derived aphorism, conjoined to pattern. **Should I merge?** 
+ #pulse : a point of introspection, occasionnally injected. 
+ #example : an example of the thought in focus
