> > So many possible ways of decomposing, so many competing claims about "what is right to see?"

-   These are the #constraints we use to rule out indicators from the possibility space of possible indicators, considering [[Dashboard Typology]]
    -   Is this **affective**?
		-  `What is a _microinteraction_ that people can do on a small scale that when aggregated can affect on a large scale?`
		- `What indicators will wake up to and want to affect?`
	  -   Is so, can it be decomposed?
	      -   we need feedback loops to **break systems out of cycles**
	      - These feedback loops need to be quick and impactful
	  -   Can the **contributions of an individual meaningfully contribute to the whole**?
	      - Part of the answer to this question is represented in the design: communicating impact in a really salient way
	      - Another part is representing issues in a way that supports such interaction (eg with Polis the issues are too big for many individuals to make a substantive difference, but the structure of the application frames them in a way that creates an effective feedback loop)
	      -   #presentation: communicating _momentum_ as a kind of nudge
    -   Is there a **reliable source of data**?
        -   If not, is there **some inference strategy** that we can do with periodic data to **infer daily values?**
    -   Is the **timescale daily**/fast enough to support the affective loop?
        -   If moves too slow (yearly), not suitable
        -   We can use the reframing approach above to try to deal with this (e.g. taking a big problem like creating legislature and creating small feedback loops that feed into actions that are powerful in aggregate)
            -   Gut reaction is that this might be necessary, because almost all of the really significant problems operate on massive timescales
-   #devilsadvocate: **If we did a live, Bartholemew Community Dashboard for SF, would this align with our vision?**
    -   No, because its not an affective dashboard: wouldnâ€™t achieve the core metric of 5% of San Franciscans checking it every day
