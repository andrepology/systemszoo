Goals
+ passive
	+ slow to update
		+ Last updated
+ large scale broad indicators to set context
  
+ visually compact
	+ poster-like & negative space to lead into active and affective
	+ Not a lot of viewport space -> information density
+ communicates timescale  
+ drifts/rotates -> presents in a gradual way through UX
+ Should work equally well for passive/affective dashboards
