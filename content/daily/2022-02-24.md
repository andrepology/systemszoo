> we direct our own evolution

+ A little dejected about KP, I'm going to assume something went horribly wrong on their end. You are brilliant, and that's very hard to communicate sometimes. Which is why I need to cultivate a [[Digital Presence]]. Invisible work is incomplete work. 
+ Need to invest, now, in [[Streamlit]] before an interview, and go all in there. 
+ Going to apply to the Masason foundation today, as this would help prop me up in some way. 
+ Going to also email Watershed with my proposal.

	+ Get shreya's help on cover letter
	+ Make sure you keyframe the UI, regardless of the state its in? 
+ Softbank

+ Apart from that, what are my options? To *just keep going.* I miss Gal, I wish she knew how important she really is to me, and how much I want to see and support her and give her security. I am going to keep going.
