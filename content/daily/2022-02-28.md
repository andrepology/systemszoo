- [x] Going to use class time to get drawings in order 
+ POST drawings into portfolio telegram bot??!
+ Really need to start on [[Streamlit]] projects
	+ Cached PCA is a solid place to start, as you'll understand the caching model as well as core UI widgets

#pulse :
+ Some things you said that hurt me
	+ "you're experiencing heartbreak but its not the end of the world"
	+ "liberated"
		+ As if what we had was this ugly thing that kept you from being yourself. 
	+ "you are going to be angry that I am happy"
		+ I fell in love with you when there were a lot of things you didn't love about yourself. I loved you all the same. 
	+ "when I get there we will fight all the time"
		+ You've hurt me too. I don't want to fight and its the last thing I want to d.  
+ I don't know if you meant any of these things, but it was the way you said it, at arms length, that felt so cold. 
+ What is this worth if its something I think about all the time, but you can tuck away, compartmentalise and not see?
