#pulse : I think I'm moving constructively here. But a couple of things are missing when it comes to [[communitydash]]:

	+ Affective is about emotion. Thank you shreyama. 
+ Clear examples
	+ Descriptive indicators for feedback
	+ A single model
		+ #strategy : "City" in kaggle
			+ Connection to [[evofinal]]
